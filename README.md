# Number parser and formatter for Dicio assistant
This *multilingual* library implements methods to **extract** numbers, dates or durations from text and **format** numbers, dates or dutations into human-readable words. It is inspired by [Mycroft's lingua-franca](https://github.com/MycroftAI/lingua-franca), from which it borrows some resource files. Currently only Italian (it-it) and English (en-us) are supported, and methods to extract dates or durations are still unavailable (though formatting is).

This repository is part of the **Dicio** project. Also check out [`dicio-android`](https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-android), [`dicio-sentences-compiler`](https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-sentences-compiler/) and [`dicio-skill`](https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-skill/). *Open to contributions :-D*
